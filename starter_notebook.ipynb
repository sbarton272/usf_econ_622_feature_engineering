    "\n",
    "Today's lesson will be on feature engineering. You'll spend the class diving into some example data, developing features and building a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work individually but will check in with other's periodically to compare ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",

    "## The Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan today is to build a classification model that predicts whether given a bunch of host's listing whether that host will receive a high number of reviews.\n",
